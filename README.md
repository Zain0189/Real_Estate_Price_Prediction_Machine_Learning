Machine learning-based real estate price prediction system as part of a course from Codebasics. Using a dataset from Kaggle, Handled missing values and removed outliers. Predictions were based on area type, location, size, society, total square foot, number of bathrooms, bedrooms, and price. Built a Flask-based web application.
